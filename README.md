Share memories with your friends!

# Voodoo iOS Founding Engineer Test

## Project Overview

Welcome. This challenge is designed to evaluate your technical skills, creativity, 
and ability to deliver a compelling product in terms of both user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) in a limited time.

You will be working on an app to share photos and chat with friends:
- *User problem*: apps such as Instagram and Snapchat have become public façades where I share highly curated pictures. I can share raw, fun pictures with my friends and chat on apps like WhatsApp, but they’re not really photo-centric.
- *Job to be done*: 1/ share ‘real’ pictures with close friends and chat, 2/ keep a shared collection of common memories.

This project is set up as a bootstrap that you will need to complete within 4 hours.


## Objectives

Your main objectives are to:

- *Implement Core Features:* build out the key functionalities of the photo-centric and chat application.
- *Focus on UI/UX:* design and implement a user interface that is intuitive, simple, and visually appealing. We're looking for innovation in how users interact with the app.
- *Write Clean Code:* ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and performance-optimized.

Feel free to implement any additional features you believe would enhance the application. Bonus functionalities are highly encouraged and welcomed.

## Key Features to Implement

- Photo Gallery: users should be able to view a collection of photos fetched from the Unsplash API (feel free to fix & improve the proposed implementation).
- Photo Selection: implement a creative and user-friendly interface for selecting and sharing photos.
- Chat Interface: design and implement a prototype of a chat feature where users can send messages and share photos (without necessary being connected to a real backend).


## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

- UI/UX Innovation: creativity in the app design and user interaction.
- Technical Proficiency: effective use of iOS technologies and coding best practices.
- Problem Solving: ability to address challenges with efficient solutions.

## Getting Started

- Review the project structure and the placeholders for the core features.
- Implement the features as outlined, focusing on UI/UX and code quality.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete your work within 4 hours and ensure the project is error-free.
- Document any significant decisions or approaches you took.
- Submit your project via email as a zip file or a GitHub repository link.

Good luck, we're looking forward to reviewing your solution!
